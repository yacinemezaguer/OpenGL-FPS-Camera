# OpenGL-FPS-Camera
Implementing an FPS-style camera control in OpenGL

This project requires [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org), [glad](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad) and [glm](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) libraries to be linked/referenced in order to work.

For now, the scene contains only two Cylinders created with code (vertices generated with a function instead of imported from a 3D software file).
You can navigate through the scene using the WASD keys and the mouse to orient the camera view.
